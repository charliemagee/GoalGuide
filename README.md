This webapp uses the code from a number of open-source projects. And it clings to the shoulders of free web services. Thanks SO MUCH to all who have given freely of their time and talent.

Stackoverflow -- http://stackoverflow.com/  This wouldn't have happened without all the help of total strangers. Amazing.

JS Fiddle -- http://jsfiddle.net/   Took me a while to get around to it, but now I usually find my errors before begging at stackoverflow.

CoffeeScript -- http://coffeescript.org/  I was just starting to learn Javascript when CoffeeScript started getting a lot of attention. I went from 99 errors per hour of
coding to 5 errors per hour. And now the errors don't involve semicolons, or brackets of various flavors.

jQuery -- http://jquery.com/  As much as I want to try out meteor or angular, this gets the job done and I know what's going on

Github -- https://github.com/   Yep.

Chrome DevTools -- https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/  Was it possible to make websites before this? (Yes, and you walked ten miles one way in the snow to get to preschool, I know.)

Device.js -- determines phone/tablet/desktop and opens appropriate index file.
https://github.com/borismus/device.js

Zepto.js -- a library based off jQuery but optimized for mobile sites and apps.
http://zeptojs.com/

Modernizr.js -- recognizes what browser is active and adjusts HTML5 and CSS for graceful degradation and progressive enhancement.
http://modernizr.com/

HTML5Boilerplate -- http://html5boilerplate.com/   gets me up to a quick start with tools that work across the browser world

bootstrap -- http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/   gets the basics up and running quicker than doing css from scratch. Drawback is that it looks like so much else out there. I haven't switched to the latest version.

IcoMoon -- http://icomoon.io/  Make your own icon font. Saves a ton of space on webapps. Lots of choices and they look good too.

Highcharts JS -- http://www.highcharts.com/   simple charting, works well. Faster than d3.js if you need it quick and don't know d3
